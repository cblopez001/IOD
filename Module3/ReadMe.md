Lab 1 Question 1:

I have console.logged the prompt in the JSLab1answers file. However, these are my answers prior to using the console.

10
-1
1
false
2
6
9px
$9 ---> incorrect answer ($45)
2
'4px' 2 ---> incorrect answer (NaN)
-9 5
-9 5 ---> incorrect answer (-14)
1
NaN
true
false
'\t \n' 2 ---> incorrect answer (-2)

Lab 1 Question 2:

I believe that let addition and let lessThan2 will not give the correct answer.
    let addition will have an incorrect answer due to concatenation of the two strings.
    

Lab 1 Question 3:

I believe that #2 zero is true, negative is true, and positive is true will give the correct answer.
The others will not print because they aren't properly defined variables.
